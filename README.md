## 📌 Overview

This project detects static **American Sign Language (ASL)** letters (A–Z except J and Z) using a custom-trained **YOLOv5m model**. It features a clean and interactive web interface built with **Streamlit**, allowing users to upload an image and get instant predictions with bounding boxes and labels.

> 💡 Built to support communication for the hearing and speech-impaired community through real-time gesture recognition.

## 🚀 Features

- 🧠 Deep learning with YOLOv5
- 📷 ASL hand gesture detection (24 static letters)
- 🌐 Streamlit-based web app
- 🛠️ CPU-compatible (no GPU required)
- 🎯 High accuracy with custom-trained weights

---

## 🧠 Model Details

- **Model**: YOLOv5m (custom trained)
- **Classes**: A–Z (excluding J and Z due to motion)
- **Framework**: PyTorch
- **Accuracy**: ~98% validation accuracy
- **Input size**: 640×640
- **Output**: Bounding box + label for each detected letter
